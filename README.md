## **Objective**
To manage and analyze a relational medical database containing patient, admission, doctor, and medical records by applying advanced SQL queries to extract meaningful healthcare insights and support data-driven decision-making.

---

## **Challenges**
- Cleaning, transforming, and validating data with missing or inconsistent values.  
- Designing complex SQL queries to answer **35+ real-world business problems**.  
- Generating dynamic outputs such as **temporary passwords** and **obesity flags**.  
- Ensuring accuracy while handling multiple tables (patients, admissions, doctors) with relational joins.

---

## **Solutions**
- Performed **data cleaning and transformation** to handle null values and ensure data integrity.  
- Executed advanced SQL queries using **JOIN**, **GROUP BY**, **HAVING**, **CASE**, **UPDATE**, and date functions.  
- Created conditional outputs such as **temporary passwords** (*patient_id + last_name length + birth year*).  
- Delivered a structured and queryable database enabling efficient analysis and reporting.

---

## **Key Insights**
- Identified **high-risk patients** and common diagnoses to assist in targeted healthcare planning.  
- Analyzed **admission patterns** by city, day, and diagnosis to reveal operational trends.  
- Calculated **BMI and obesity flags**, enabling quick patient health assessments.  
- Highlighted unique **patient names**, **birth years**, and **gender distributions** to uncover demographic patterns.
